# 🐼 Pandas Data Manipulation Project

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of core **pandas** functions to perform various data manipulation and analysis tasks. It focuses on **practical application** of common operations such as reading files, joining datasets, merging, grouping, filtering, and aggregation. This project serves as both a learning tool and a reference for foundational data wrangling techniques in Python.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- Reading data from **CSV**, **Excel**, and **JSON** formats using `read_csv()`, `read_excel()`, and `read_json()`
- Merging and joining DataFrames using `merge()` and `join()`
- Grouping and aggregating data with `groupby()` and `agg()`
- Filtering rows and selecting columns
- Handling missing values (`isnull()`, `fillna()`)
- Applying custom functions with `apply()` and `lambda`
- Renaming and rearranging columns
- Exporting cleaned datasets with `to_csv()` and `to_excel()`
